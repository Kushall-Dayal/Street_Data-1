This visualization tends to look on the bigger picture of the traffic violations in Chicago.. The *surprising* thing I found out was Zipcodes:*60612,60629,60640* have low speed violations but very high Street Light violations. The take away is that only speed violations should not be counted upon for measuring street violations. This visualization was done by merging two data sets that included information on speed camera violations and red-light violations. Then the violations of each type were mapped to see the effect of each other’s presence.

**Visualization 1**: Red circles depict speed cameras and Black triangles depict red light cameras.

**Visualization 2**: This is an interactive dashboard. The areas are highlighted on the map based on the zip code; the bar chart depicts the number of speed and red light violations in each zip code. Selecting the area on the map shows the violations done in each area.

**Visualization 3**: The visualization depicts the total number of violations done in each zip code. Red color depicts the speed camera violations and black color depicts red light violations.  

**Aspect no.2**: Violations on weekdays by Zipcode

This aspect hovers over the violations by each weekday. Interesting fact about this finding was that zipcodes:*60619,60623,60631,60636,60641* have had no violations on the weekend !Other concerns regarding lower reading per zip code was that there were lesser number of cameras installed in some areas,Zipcode:60607,60612,60623,60624,60657 can have more cameras installed.

**Visualization 1**: This visualization depicts the total violations in each zip code by each weekday.

**Visualization 2**: It depicts the total violations occurred on each weekday over the time.

**Visualization 3**: This is an interactive dashboard that allows you to choose the area by zip code on the map. The selection then narrows down the total violations over the weekdays occurred over time by zip code of the area selected.

**Visualization 4**: This is an exploratory analysis which tends to find the number camera in each zip code.
 

**Aspect no.3**: Violations by age

This is an interactive dashboard that allows the audience to select the year and age .The plot then depicts the total violations by that age group in the selected year.
*Non-trivial* fact about this visualization is that most numbers of violations are done in the area where the median age is 38.80. Which is significantly higher than other age groups.
