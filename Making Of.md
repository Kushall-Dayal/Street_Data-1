Aspect no.1:**Effect of red light cameras on speed violations**

This apsect tends to look on the bigger picture that is how the rules are being followed in general.We can see on the map that there are less speed camera violations in the vicinty of red lights.There are significantky more speed violations in the outskirts of the city.And, northern part of the city is more prone to speed violations.
But the **surprising** thing I found out was Zipcodes:**60612,60629,60640** have low speed violations but very high Street Light violations.The take away is that only speed violations should not be counted upon for measuring street violations.
This visualisation was done by merging two data sets that included information on speed camera violations and red light violations.Then the violations of each type were mapped to see the effect of each others presence.Red circles depict speed cameras and Black triangles depict red light cameras.   

Aspect no.2:**Violations on weekdays by Zipcode**

This aspect hovers over the violations in each zipcode .
**Interesting** fact about this finding was that zipcodes:**60619,60623,60631,60636,60641** (marked in black) have had no violations on the weekend !
The other colored cameras have had lower readings over the time, which is a good thing to consider .Other concerns regarding lower reading per zipcode was that there were lesser number of cameras installed in some areas, Zipcode:*60643,60642,60662,60645,60642* can have more cameras.

Aspect no.3:**Violations based on age**

*Non-trivial* fact about this visualisation is that most numbers of violations are done in the area where the median age is 38.80.Which is significantly higher than other age groups.

The Bars were plotted with x-axis as the age and Y-axis was the sum of violations.The same is repeated for each year to see the trend over the time
